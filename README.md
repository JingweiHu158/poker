I can’t directly access your VS Code or the contents of your cloned repository, but I can guide you through how to plan and execute this project effectively. Here’s a structured project plan for building a poker assistant that works on simulated games:

Project Plan: Poker Assistant

1. Goal of the Project
	•	Objective: Create a poker assistant that captures your screen, identifies your cards, tracks the game’s progress, calculates odds, and recommends the best decisions.
	•	Scope: Simulated poker games on your laptop, ensuring it remains ethical and educational.

2. Project Workflow

Step 1: Repository Setup
	1.	Clone your repository and ensure it’s linked to a version control system (e.g., GitHub).
	2.	Organize the project folder structure:

poker-assistant/
├── data/                 # For training datasets, if needed
├── src/                  # Core source code
│   ├── capture/          # Screen capture module
│   ├── detection/        # Card detection and OCR
│   ├── analysis/         # Poker odds calculation
│   ├── gui/              # User interface
├── tests/                # Unit tests
├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
├── README.md             # Project documentation
└── .gitignore            # Ignored files

Step 2: Technology Stack
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Libraries/Tools:
	•	Screen Capture: mss, pyautogui
	•	Image Processing: OpenCV, Pillow
	•	OCR: pytesseract (Tesseract OCR)
	•	Poker Engine: PyPokerEngine
	•	GUI: tkinter, PyQt, or Dash
	•	Machine Learning (Optional): scikit-learn, TensorFlow

Step 3: Functional Requirements
	1.	Screen Capture:
	•	Detect and capture the poker game window.
	•	Ensure that the region of interest (ROI) is adaptable for different screen resolutions.
	2.	Card Detection:
	•	Identify your hand cards and community cards using OCR or image recognition.
	•	Preprocess images (e.g., grayscale, thresholding) for better accuracy.
	3.	Poker Odds Analysis:
	•	Calculate odds based on visible cards and probabilities of possible hands.
	•	Provide recommendations (e.g., fold, call, raise).
	4.	User Interface:
	•	Display detected cards, community cards, and odds.
	•	Show real-time recommendations.
	5.	Game State Tracking:
	•	Maintain the state (pre-flop, flop, turn, river).
	•	Log actions for future analysis.

Step 4: Implementation Phases

Phase 1: Basic Framework
	•	Setup the project structure.
	•	Implement screen capture and ROI detection.

Phase 2: Card Detection
	•	Integrate OCR to detect cards.
	•	Test and refine preprocessing for accuracy.

Phase 3: Odds Calculation
	•	Add poker logic for hand rankings and probability estimation.
	•	Use PyPokerEngine or write custom functions for odds.

Phase 4: Decision Support
	•	Develop an algorithm to recommend actions based on odds and game state.

Phase 5: User Interface
	•	Create a GUI for real-time display of information.

Phase 6: Optimization
	•	Optimize for speed and accuracy.
	•	Train a machine learning model for advanced predictions, if applicable.

3. Example Milestone Plan

Milestone	Deliverable	Time Estimate
Setup and Dependencies	Repository with working environment setup	1 day
Screen Capture	ROI capture from poker screen	2 days
Card Detection	OCR for hand and community cards	3-4 days
Odds Calculation	Poker odds engine integrated	2-3 days
User Interface	Real-time GUI with stats and recommendations	2-3 days
Testing and Debugging	Fully functional assistant with logging	2-3 days

4. Key Challenges
	•	OCR Accuracy: Requires tuning preprocessing and detecting non-standard fonts.
	•	Performance: Ensure the system is fast enough for real-time updates.
	•	Flexibility: Make the system adaptable to different screen sizes and poker layouts.

5. Final Deliverables
	•	A working poker assistant that:
	•	Detects cards and calculates odds.
	•	Displays recommendations in real time.
	•	Logs game actions for analysis.
	•	Documentation:
	•	README.md: Instructions for setup and usage.
	•	Code comments for maintainability.
